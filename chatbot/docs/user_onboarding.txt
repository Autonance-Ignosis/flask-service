User Onboarding & Platform Flow
Overview
This section covers the complete user journey on Autonance — from registration using Google Authentication to accessing financial services like loan applications, mandate setup, transaction monitoring, and analytics.

1.⁠ ⁠Registration & KYC Verification
Users register/sign in using Google Authentication (OAuth).

On first login, users are required to:

Upload PAN card

Upload Aadhar card

This initiates the KYC (Know Your Customer) process.

KYC verification is carried out by authorized back-office systems and typically takes 1–2 business days.

Until the KYC is approved, access to other features is restricted.

2.⁠ ⁠Loan Application Process
Once KYC is verified, the user gains access to the loan application module.

Features include:

Filters based on loan type (e.g., Home, Education, Personal)

Ability to browse offers from multiple partner banks

After submitting a loan application:

The selected bank receives the applicant's details.

The bank performs its own verification and may accept or reject the application.

Status updates are visible on the user's dashboard.

3.⁠ ⁠Mandate Setup & Loan Disbursement
If the loan is approved, the user is prompted to:

Set up a mandate using any of their existing bank accounts.

Provide correct bank details and select a start date for EMI deductions.

The bank then verifies the submitted mandate.

Upon successful mandate approval:

The loan amount is disbursed to the user's account.

EMI payments begin automatically based on the date specified in the mandate.

⚠ Legal & Compliance Notes:
Any false information (e.g., incorrect bank details) can lead to immediate rejection and legal action by the bank.

If the user's bank account lacks sufficient balance:

Warning notifications are sent.

After a set number of warnings, the bank has the right to pursue legal action.

4.⁠ ⁠Bank Transaction & Analytics
Beyond loans, users can:

View their linked bank accounts.

Track real-time balances.

Access a transaction history.

Visualize spending/income trends using graphical analytics.
This helps users monitor their financial behavior and plan better
