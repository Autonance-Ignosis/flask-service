Overview
Once a user's loan is approved, a mandate setup is required before any funds are disbursed. This section describes the loan selection process, mandate requirements, and legal responsibilities involved in repayment through automatic deductions.

Workflow
Loan Application Interface

Users can apply for loans through multiple banks integrated into Autonance.

Loan-type-specific filters help users select the most suitable option based on:

Type: Home Loan, Personal Loan, Car Loan, etc.

This allows for a more personalized loan discovery experience.

Loan Application and Bank Review

Once the user submits the application:

The respective bank receives and begins verifying the request.

This verification process takes approximately 3–4 business days.

Loan Approval

Upon approval, the user is notified via the Autonance dashboard and email.

At this stage, the loan is not yet disbursed.

The user must proceed to set up a mandate.

Mandate Setup (Mandatory Before Disbursal)

The user provides bank details for EMI deduction:

This bank may be the same or different from the loan-issuing bank.

Details must be accurate and verifiable.

The user selects a mandate start date for EMI deduction.

This mandate authorizes the selected bank to auto-debit EMIs on the agreed schedule.

Mandate Verification

The bank verifies the mandate via secure channels (e.g., NACH, eSign, bank APIs).

Only after successful mandate verification, the loan amount is credited to the user’s bank account.

EMI and Legal Policy

EMI will be auto-deducted from the user’s account monthly starting from the selected date.

If there is insufficient balance:

A warning is issued to the user.

Repeated failures (e.g., 3 warnings) will allow the bank to:

Take legal action

Report the user to credit authorities

False Information Clause

Submitting false or misleading mandate/bank information will result in:

Immediate rejection of the loan

Potential legal consequences from the bank

Possible blacklisting from future loans
